progress.

## current state

i've been working alone on this since its start, but i feel like i cannot keep
this up, due to stress issues and loads of work for just one. that's why i'm
looking for a __meteor developer with too much free time__ to help me out. it
also had obvious benefits in the fact that we can look over each others code.

## installation

1. have `meteor` installed
2. clone this repository
3. `meteor`

(if you want to actually _deploy_ it, consider something like meteor up)

## license

MIT
